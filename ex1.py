text = 'I heard so many_good things about this place so I was pretty juiced to try it. I’m from Cali and I heard Shake Shack is comparable to IN-N-OUT and I gotta say, Shake Shake wins hands down. Surprisingly, the line was short and we waited about 10 MIN. to order. I ordered a regular cheeseburger, fries and a black/white shake. So yummerz. I love the location too! It’s in the middle of the city and the view is breathtaking. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in NYC. I’m from California and I must say, Shake Shack is better than IN-NOUT, all day, err’day. Would I pay $15+ for a burger here? No. But for the price point they are asking for, this is a definite bang for your buck (though for some, the opportunity cost of waiting in line might outweigh the cost savings) Thankfully, I came in before the lunch swarm descended and I ordered a shake shack (the special burger with the patty + fried cheese & portabella topping) and a coffee milk shake. The beef patty was very juicy and snugly packed within a soft potato roll. On the downside, I could do without the fried portabella-thingy, as the crispy taste conflicted with the juicy, tender burger. How does shake shack compare with in-andout or 5-guys? I say a very close tie, and I think it comes down to personal affliations. On the shake side, true to its name, the shake was well churned and very thick and luscious. The coffee flavor added a tangy taste and complemented the vanilla shake well.'
